## Project <a name="project"></a>
My project will be a reflection of what i have learnt so far from the (Full Stack Developer course). KeyBeats is a memory game which introduces various instruments that will light up when randomly generated, 
players must then press the corresponding key in order to correctly select the instrument which is highlighted. 
The game will progressively speed up and the time allowed to select each instrument will decrease making for a challenging memory game.

The site is made up of three individual pages with a consistent background across all of them.
The three pages and their purposes are as follows:

- **Landing Page:** Simple design, eye catching image, navigation menu into the game.
- **Game Page:** Instruction modal popup to inform player on what to do and where to play game.
- **Contact :** Contact form for direct inquiry, feedback or ideas.

## UX <a name="ux"></a>
This site brings a web based game to the user and allows the player to easily navigate through from landing page to full game mode with only a single click of the mouse. 
Instructions are clearly outlined and are easy to find from the navigation menu on the home page. A contact form has also been added for queries, feedback or development ideas from players
 
### User Stories

- The user is able to enjoy playing the memory game.
- The user has the ability to contact creators with ideas, questions and feedback.
- The user will be instructed on how to play the game via a modal popup
